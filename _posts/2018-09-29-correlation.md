In case you wonder how not to fall into the trap of confusing correlation and causation: 
This is done by using your logical thinking and your domain knowledge. 
We all know that sunglasses sales don't cause ice cream sales.
But there are more complex examples where you need extended domain knowledge. 
For example, you could argue that there are more jellyfishes at the Mediterranean beaches nowadays because of global warming. 
But to prove this causation you would need extended knowledge and analysis.
