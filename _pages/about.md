Related to my personal projects in the next months, you will find the following topics here:

- <span style="font-weight: bold;">`Big Data`</span> project experiences 
- Useful <span style="font-weight: bold;">`Python`</span> scripts to better handle the data jungle
- My learnings and reviews from <span style="font-weight: bold;">`Data Engineering/Science`</span> courses and books
- Organizations and individuals who use data for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">`good cause`</span>
- <span style="font-weight: bold;">`Text Mining / NLP related posts`</span> (“Which is are part of my Bachelor’s Computer Science thesis that starts this October”)
