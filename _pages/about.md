Hey folks!

Digital data is now a huge part of our lives. We generate tons of data every day and use it more or less consciously.  
In this era of ours, the Homo Datius not only has to acknowledge his responsibility towards his own data. 
But at the same time, he has a lot to learn and understand in order to handle all this incoming information streams.

I am grateful to be a part of this and I want to contribute to this century of data. 
This is why I want to share with you some great topics around my learning path towards getting the handle of data as a Data Enthusiast. 
On this path I am determined to find ways to use data for a good cause.
